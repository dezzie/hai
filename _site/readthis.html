                <p>For most Americans, buying a home means taking out a mortgage loan. Shortly after applying for a mortgage and shortly before closing on it, homebuyers receive a booklet. This is because the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (TILA-RESPA) want homebuyers to know how to protect themselves from unfair or unreasonable fees and pratices. But no one reads it.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">Upon getting involved in this project, the existing team asked design to develop three visual concepts that would inform how they would re-write the text of the disclosure. We were asked to create the cover for these concepts first:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A workbook</li>
                        <li>A game</li>
                        <li>A story</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>These three concepts would be vetted in user testing. The assumption was that if testers had a clear preference for one cover over another, consumers would be more likely to open and read the information within.</p>

                <p>It's a challenge to design without any content. It's not easy to reset expectations either. My goals in this phase of the project were to coax out the business's fundamental vision, and get to the root of what they were really trying to achieve. Then, I would change their minds.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">The team came inspired by the book Switch, which runs along the lines of behavioral design stuff I've noodled on before.</p>

                <p>What behavior do we want to change? When? Where? How do we direct, what will that look in writing, what are the triggers, and what is the destination? After interaction is done, how do we shape paths, reinforce points, build habits? Is there potential for spreading the word?</p>

                <p>Seeing this made me understand why they wanted to explore those concepts. But I wanted to reel them back in first.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">Luckily, they are wonderfully open-minded and excited to participate in the design process. We learned that their goals were to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Just get people to open the booklet</li>
                        <li>Empower homebuyers to shop around before saying yes</li>
                        <li>Inform homebuyers on how to protect themselves against unfair fees and practices</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Based on this information, design proposed some alternate conceptsâ€“mainly to keep the conversation going, get some content rolling in, and to explore together.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Present vs Future</li>
                        <li>Time-based chunks of content and tasks</li>
                        <li>Do's and don'ts</li>
                    </ol>

           <h6>Exploring content presentation</h6>
            <!--first column-->
            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">Knowing that it would be highly unlikely to mold the entire disclosure around one type of content, like all worksheets, or all pros vs cons, we explored ways to present small amounts of content in the best way for that specific content. The assumption being that this would be make better use of testing time, and maximize simple language and clarity of information to the consumer.</p>


                <p>The result was a pattern library of sorts. My goal was to make sure that patterns were associated with a concrete goal, and the ability to write that goal into a test--when a consumer interacts with that content, what would success and what would failure look like?</p>

            </div>

        </div><!--end first row-->



                <div class="row content-row">
           <h6>Selling the design process</h6>
            <!--first column-->
            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">Using the 5 concepts put together among the team, I ran an exercise to show why some directions would fail to reach their goals, and to point out how any one direction would have holes in reaching the desired effect. In the exercise I also brought up questions of the lifespan of the document (this document will be given to consumers for like, ever), and whether it would work with the CFPB's brand and voice.</p>

                <p>The goal here, again, was to get some content rolling in, which would assist design in understanding the problem better, create better work, and keep team time efficient.</p>

                <p>We were able to narrow down the business to three concepts, two of which design pitched:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Present vs Future</li>
                        <li>Time-based chunks</li>
                        <li>Workbook</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>The next challenge was to demonstrate a diversified way of displaying content to maximize success. Using some of our patterns, we plugged in preliminary content we received.</p>
            </div>
            <!--end first column-->

        </div><!--end first row-->


                        <div class="row content-row">
           <h6>Current status</h6>
            <!--first column-->
            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p class="context">At this point, my role in the project trailed off, as I was pulled onto another project. The business at that point came around to the reality of how hard it is to pull off a strict concept for such a long document, particularly when its designers don't have any of it.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, bringing in user experience to products like helps the Bureau's data-informed decisions about how to effectively reach the American consumer.</p>
