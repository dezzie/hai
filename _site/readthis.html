                <p>For most Americans, buying a home means taking out a mortgage loan. Shortly after applying for a mortgage and shortly before closing on it, homebuyers receive a booklet. This is because the Truth in Lending Act–Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (TILA-RESPA) wants homebuyers to know how to protect themselves from unfair or unreasonable fees and pratices. But no one reads it.</p>

    <div class="container">
                             <h6>Context</h6>
        <div class="row content-row">
            <div class="col-md-8 portfolio-item">
                <p>One of the provisions that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act#Title_X_.E2.80.93_Bureau_of_Consumer_Financial_Protection" target="new">Dodd-Frank Act</a> tasked the CFPB with was to update these disclosures. Entrusted with generous creative freedom, Consumer Education and Engagement reached out to Design to develop an effective way to deliver education and help homebuyers make critical decisions.</p>
                 <p>Design was presented with three different concepts. Fleshing these out would give the business direction on how to re-write the disclosure's content:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A workbook</li>
                        <li>A game</li>
                        <li>A story</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Two of these three covers would be vetted in user testing. If consumers demonstrated a clear preference for one cover over another, they would be more likely to open and interact with the disclosure. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 portfolio-item">
                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/booklets/current_disclosure.png">

        <h6>Getting on the same page</h6>
        <div class="row content-row">
            <div class="col-md-8 portfolio-item">
                <p>But it's hard to design without any content. So to get a clearer idea of the business's vision, I tried to understand what they wanted to achieve with their content. I learned that they were inspired by the book <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/" target="new">Switch</a>, which promotes many of the same ideals found in <a href="http://captology.stanford.edu/projects/behaviordesign.html" target="new" >behavioral design</a>. Jackpot.</p>
                <p>Getting the business pumped about this book made it easier to coax out their thoughts on how the new disclosure would fit in with this paradigm. Together, we identified these objectives:
                <ul>
                <li>Behavior change: at minimum, to get homebuyers to pick up the disclosure and open it</li>
                <li>Behavior change: at second best, to get homebuyers to read the content</li>
                <li>Behavior change: at best, to get homebuyers to act on the content</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The team wanted something that would introduce, guide, and build habits. Seeing this made me understand why they wanted to explore the workbook, game, and story concepts.</p>

                <p>Based on what we learned the business wanted to achieve, design proposed some alternate concepts to keep the creative oil burning, and get some content rolling in.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p>In order to pull the business away from developing full content for six concepts, I ran an exercise to show why some creative directions would fail to reach any of their goals. The exercise would also demonstrate how any blanket concept we chose would also fail to reach all goals.</p>
                <p>The exercise allowed us to discuss the impact of any of these concepts on the lifespan of the document (this document will be given to consumers for like, forever), and whether they would work with the CFPB's brand and voice.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p>We were able to narrow down the business to three concepts:

                        <li>Time-based tasks for busy people</li>

                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>The next challenge was to demonstrate how successfully we would be able to display the content we had to work with.</p>

                <p>To show the business how the content they had provided would work with the concepts they still wanted to explore, I set up a pattern library of sorts. The goal of this exercise was to discourage the business from writing three different versions of the content, and encourage quicker decisions about one.</p>
            </div>

             <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p>Likewise, the pattern library made it easier to think about user testing goals. Instead of gathering general impressions about a concept cover or the entire disclosure, the team could think about their content in the context of the behaviors they wanted to attain.</p>

                  <p>At this point, I had to go work on another project and tag team another UX designer to take over the work.</p>
                  <p>In discovering ways to revise a document that has been a part of the homebuying process for decades, this wasn't the best example of following a human-centered design process. The business' intentions were always focused on the user–but it became attached to creative ideas much too early, ideas that operated on assumptions and not observations. This is an easy trap when your audience is the entire American people, because most of us can theoretically buy a house.</p>
                <p>If I could describe what I would do differently, on a napkin--</p>

            <div class="col-md-8 portfolio item">
                <p>My goals as a UX designer in this project were to get the business to define content goals and desired outcomes, and to move them away from creative directions that I knew would not work for them. I led exercises to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the concepts we could pursue, to reset the expectation that one concept could provide an effective solution for all content.</p>
                <p>If thinking of a bigger picture, this saved the Design Ops team at the CFPB time, people, and money. When a business can't communicate their needs and goals to a creative team, having a UX professional ask the right questions can help everybody start over.</p>
