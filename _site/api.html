                <p>The CFPB believes that making public data easy to use is necessary for government transparency. It's a major part of why they release open source software and engage the developer community. With the launch of <a href="hmda.html">HMDA</a>, the Bureau saw an opportunity to showcase its toughest API, but they wanted to get their documentation right. Serving in both user experience and front-end roles, I used lean UX strategy to design efficient content and reach out to other government agencies and the local developer community for usability testing and feedback.

With API documentation that addressed developers first and not as adjuncts to advocacy groups or mortgage data experts, devs would better see the CFPB as a potential resource or inspiration for their own work.

                <p class="context">Hiring a user experience designer to design your software documentation is not something common. That's why it was exciting to team up with other UX'ers working on government API usability at <a href="18f.gsa.gov">18f</a> to learn about what works and what doesn't with our target users.</p>
                <p class="context">18f's goal was to compare other government documentation with what they see to be the gold standard in government–ours. By having seasoned developers in the private sector walk me through their thinking on our docs, my goal was to find out if we had indeed created simple content, that conveyed HMDA data accurately, and that flowed seamlessly from question to answer.</p>
                <p class="context">The value in getting outside perspective is actionable feedback, a better connection between government and citizen developers, and ultimately better API products that better serve consumers. After the session, one of the devs we spoke with blogged about <a href="http://govtribe.com/blog/2014/4/24/gsa-government-api-usability-session" target="new">why he appreciated it and thought it was important</a>.</p>

        <!--start of testing section-->
            <h6 id="iteration">Learning from user behavior</h6>
            <p class="context">The most valuable thing learned from usability testing wasn't whether developers found the documentation pleasant (which they did) or impressive (that too), but insight into broader Bureau efforts to engage the open source community and recruit developers. These were the biggest take-aways:
                <ol>
                    <li>Developers appreciated being able to use the API immediately</li>
                        <p>Links were included to all endpoints when mentioned and to queries when used in an example. 
                    <li>Interactive documentation is expected
                        <p>This does not mean skipping context or definitions, but rather making sure that reinforcement of those concepts with something real is there alongside that content.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Govspeak is a turn-off
                        <p>When acronyms, insider terms, and obscure abbreviations are here to stay it is even more important to use plain language whenever possible.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Devs are users too
                        <p>Treating developers with the same care that other target audiences are made them feel heard, which in turn leads the Bureau to be heard by them.</p></li>
                    <li>Commitment
                        <p>Those devs who are willing to invest their business or time into using government APIs need reassurance that the Bureau will maintain it responsibly. This is not a problem that can be solved by more open source work–the CFPB is ultimately responsible for collecting, releasing, and verifying much of its data.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <!--start of testing section-->
            <h6 id="iteration">Iteration</h6>
            <p class="context">Time for more Github. In order to prove to the developer community that their feedback was not given in vain, I synthesized it into <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation" target="new">Github Issues</a>. A feature used by devs and designers alike to discuss solutions and manage tasks, I leveraged them to document for future iterations on this project.</p>
            <p class="context">Anyone can see this backlog of fixes and challenges. Each includes the who, what, when, where, why and how of the current state and desired future state. Yes, there are pictures. <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/api/issues/12" target="new">This is a good example.</a></p>
            <p class="context">I was able to give a more in-depth talk on the process of using Github to carry out this aspect of user experience work. Those mildly saucy and opinionated slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dezzie/api-case-study" target="new">here</a>.</p>

            <h6 id="iteration">Final thoughts</h6>
            <p class="context">In a discipline where "numbers" make many a design practitioner uneasy, taking on challenges like the HMDA project have allowed me to nurture a UX skillset that not only can solve very real problems, but that make it clear what I can bring to a UX team.</p>
            <p class="context">Working on HMDA API's documentation was a similar privilege. In order to truly empathize with my user and give them a functional and workable solution, I had to eat my own dog food.</p>
            <p class="context">It was also flattering to see other government organizations fork this project for their own use. While using this project as a visual template alone does not guarantee success, it's still nice to see:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/" target="new">SAM API</a></li>
