                <p>The CFPB believes that making public data easy to use is necessary for government transparency. It's a major part of why they release open source software and engage the developer community. With the launch of <a href="hmda.html">HMDA</a>, the Bureau saw an opportunity to showcase its toughest API, but they wanted to get their documentation right. Serving in both user experience and front-end roles, I used lean UX strategy to design efficient content and reach out to other government agencies and the local developer community for usability testing and feedback.

                <p>During the discovery phased of the HMDA project, we heard from its technologist stakeholders that they'd like to show the developer community how the CFPB uses technology to improve the financial lives of consumers throughout the country. The HMDA API, they explained, was the perfect opportunity to leverage a federally-mandated public data project as a way for techies to be civically involved. The creatives and developers on the HMDA team used its API to build a useful tool–unleashed to the public, the sky was the limit.</p>

                <p>Like many members of the developer community, people at the CFPB value openness and transparency. They embrace new ideas and technology. They are focused on continuously improving, learning, and pushing themselves to be great. As a result, there is a strong drive to promote open source software within and outside the agency.</p>

                <p>This message marches to its own drumbeat. Unlike the greater HMDA project, where delivering data about the mortgage industry was the end goal, here HMDA data was just the means to a different end; a call to action for nerds everywhere to serve their country through the soft glow of their computer screens.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p>So we needed to address them directly, not as adjuncts to advocacy groups or mortgage data experts–the primary audiences of HMDA. First and foremost, we needed to provide the means for success. This was the philosophy that I followed as a designer–I needed to create documentation that solved problems efficiently. But I also didn't want to shut out anyone who would need to do a little homework to get up to speed. They could have great ideas too.</p>


                <p>Working closely with the API's author, <a href="http://smashingboxes.com/ideas/who-is-durhams-first-code-academy" target="blank">Clinton Dreisbach</a>, and visual designer <a href="http://mehgan.com" target="blank">Mehgan Iulo</a>, our concept was designed to meet these goals:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring content in line with CFPB brand and voice–this included a heuristic analysis of extant documentation</li>
                        <li>Edit Clinton's personal documentation to speak to HMDA experts too</li>
                        <li>Design content into itneractions that solved problems and stayed out of the way</li>

                 <p>The idea that hands-on learning is more effective led us to fork the <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="blank">Swagger project</a>, whose features leverage the way HMDA API was designed to create an interactive console. However, to avoid creating an insular experience, I pushed for a pedagogic vision–one that introduces concepts approachably and reinforces them before handing over the keys to the car.</p>
                <p>Initial concept validation was done using paper prototypes. Forking the <a href="http://cfpb.github.io/eregs" target="blank">Eregs documentation repository</a> allowed us to prototype our static content and visual explorations. Forking <a href="">Swagger's repo</a> allowed us to prototype our interactive content. </p>

            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
                <p>We learned from the prototype phase of the project that the main navigation served as a useful, mostly-linear flow that introduced newcomers to the API. The Swagger console served as a reference point for the types of information in HMDA, and was favored more than the Field Reference section we built.</p>
                <p>In addition to writing and editing the content in the prototype, all front-end work was completed by me.</p>

                <p>I teamed up with UX'ers interested in government API usability at <a href="18f.gsa.gov">18f</a> to learn how to better engage our common audience, and in particular, what made HMDA API's documentation successful. I gave the 18f group a short talk about the process behind our work, and the goals I wanted to validate with the 3 private sector developers that would walk me through their interactions with the content. All deliverables were <a href="https://github.com/18F/API-Usability-Testing" target="new">open-sourced on Github.</a> They, and <a href="http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/86214382873/packaging-up-api-usability-testing-for-agency-re-use" target="new">many of my one-liners</a> were used to promote usability testing on other government projects.</p>

                <p>Face-time and actionable feedback strengthens the relationship between government and citizen developers, ultimately resulting in better  service to consumers. If sparked a conversation too. After the session, one of our testers blogged about <a href="http://govtribe.com/blog/2014/4/24/gsa-government-api-usability-session" target="new">why he appreciated it and thought it was important</a>.</p>

            <h6 id="iteration">Learning from user behavior</h6>
            <p class="context">The most valuable thing learned from usability testing wasn't whether developers found the documentation pleasant (which they did) or impressive (that too), but insight into broader Bureau efforts to engage the open source community and recruit developers. These were the biggest take-aways:
                <ol>
                    <li>Developers appreciated being able to use the API immediately</li>
                        <p>Links were included to all endpoints when mentioned and to queries when used in an example. 
                    <li>Interactive documentation is expected
                        <p>This does not mean skipping context or definitions, but rather making sure that reinforcement of those concepts with something real is there alongside that content.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Govspeak is a turn-off
                        <p>When acronyms, insider terms, and obscure abbreviations are here to stay it is even more important to use plain language whenever possible.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Devs are users too
                        <p>Treating developers with the same care that other target audiences are made them feel heard, which in turn leads the Bureau to be heard by them.</p></li>
                    <li>Commitment
                        <p>Those devs who are willing to invest their business or time into using government APIs need reassurance that the Bureau will maintain it responsibly. This is not a problem that can be solved by more open source work–the CFPB is ultimately responsible for collecting, releasing, and verifying much of its data.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h6 id="iteration">Iteration</h6>
            <p class="context">Time for more Github. In order to prove to the developer community that their feedback was not given in vain, I synthesized it into <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation" target="new">Github Issues</a>. A feature used by devs and designers alike to discuss solutions and manage tasks, I leveraged them to document for future iterations on this project.</p>
            <p class="context">Anyone can see this backlog of fixes and challenges. Each includes the who, what, when, where, why and how of the current state and desired future state. Yes, there are pictures. <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/api/issues/12" target="new">This is a good example.</a></p>
            <p class="context">I was able to give a more in-depth talk on the process of using Github to carry out this aspect of user experience work. Those mildly saucy and opinionated slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dezzie/api-case-study" target="new">here</a>.</p>

            <h6 id="iteration">Final thoughts</h6>
            <p class="context">In a discipline where "numbers" make many a design practitioner uneasy, taking on challenges like the HMDA project have allowed me to nurture a UX skillset that not only can solve very real problems, but that make it clear what I can bring to a UX team.</p>
            <p class="context">Working on HMDA API's documentation was a similar privilege. In order to truly empathize with my user and give them a functional and workable solution, I had to eat my own dog food.</p>
            <p class="context">It was also flattering to see other government organizations fork this project for their own use. While using this project as a visual template alone does not guarantee success, it's still nice to see:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/" target="new">SAM API</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://18f.github.io/API-Usability-Testing/" target="new">API Usability Testing Kit, API Developer Program (18f)</a></li>
