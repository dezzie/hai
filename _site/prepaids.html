                <p>Prepaid cards are sort of like debit or credit cards...but not really. To understand their impact on consumers, it's best to think of them literally–a card you purchase. Whichever way you think of it, prepaid cards have become popular, and they make industry a lot of money with undisclosed and intentionally confusing fees.</p> 

                <p>The CFPB is working on an upcoming rule to protect consumers from these practices. As a user experience designer, I helped prototype a label that  encourages consumers to comparison shop and stay away from shady deals.</p>

                <p>Currently, each prepaid card company's retail package discloses different information. Each has a different style and format. We think these things make it difficult to find the information important to consumers, and do side-by-side comparisons. When most consumers need to limit their shopping time to the checkout line, it's no surprise that 68% of them don't comparison shop before making a purchase.</p>

            <p>Initially, the Design Ops team was asked to develop a way to visually compare fees in the hopes that they'd motivate consumers to comparison shop and read disclosures fully before making a purchase. The business had contracted a testing firm who would test two versions of design work. Based on the impressions of consumer testers, the preferred version would be chosen as a model form for the prepaids industry.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 portfolio-item">
            <p>The design team asked questions about the business's current direction, and we found that lobbyist groups had taken a stab at solving the prepaid card disclosure problem. Something, they argued, had to work as a visual hook and get consumers to comparison shop. They had learned from focus groups that consumers ultimately were choosing cards based on one or two factors.

            <p>The problem was that the Design Ops team had just gotten this UX designer and they decided to put her on this project to help solve this "visual hook" puzzle. She asked the business some hard questions like, "How do you assume your work will actually do what you want it to do?" and "Why did you choose the content on the form?" They didn't get think this was important, and they got kinda grumpy, but that was okay.

We prohibited fine print from appearing in multiple places of the form–we placed our bets on users' uncanny ability to ignore it in a way that our lawyer-based stakeholders could not. Instead of referencing as many fees as possible on limited real estate, we listed the total number of fees, and placed calls to action beneath to get details.</p>
            <p class="context">The challenge throughout the project was to focus this product for the user's shopping experience, not the Bureau's legal team.

            <p>At this point, the business had requested that we test a "long form" or a complete disclosure of all fees.

                <p>The biggest thing we learned was that testers kept going back to those four visually prominent fees. Even after asking about questions of fee comprehension, the dealmakers and dealbreakers were at the top of the form. Fine print left more questions unanswered than answered. Testers were able to place one or more of those fees in the context of their previous shopping choices, and more often than not, times when they were burned. Those fees jumped out at them, but more importantly, they were personal.

            <p class="context">We talked to some lobbyists who felt very strongly about their work, but my slightly saucy opinion sides with the talented people I worked with on the design team who kind of shot down their work from a realistic packaging perspective. Our model form is designed to fit on a card packaging system already in production, where fee information is available instantly, without opening a package. Industry would be less willing to cooperate if the CFPB told them to make more expensive packaging that was not toddler-proof.</p>
