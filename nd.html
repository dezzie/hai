                <p>Over the course of two sessions, I met with the directors at the Institute of Church Life (ICL) to discuss their vision for the University of Notre Dame’s direct service to the Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>As a user experience designer, I leveraged my design thinking and lean UX training to conduct discovery work, focusing on content strategy and brand identity. I coached a group of thinkers and doers on how to begin telling their stories online while respecting the University of Notre Dame's existing brand standards, guidelines, and best practices.</p>

        <h6>Context</h6>
        <p class="context">The Institute for Church Life (ICL) animates the University of Notre Dame’s direct service to the Church through outreach in theological education, research, faith formation, and leadership development.</p>
        <p class="context">The ICL reaches communities on a local and regional level, as well as the whole spectrum of men and women Church leaders. These relationships nurture the Church’s mission of evangelization and healing, while also informing the ICL about how best to channel Notre Dame’s resources in response to concerns and challenges facing the Church. Within the University community, the ICL engages students on the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as scholars of the University, in interpreting and addressing the complex realities of contemporary Church life.</p>

        <p class="context">The first session focused on understanding the current state of the ICL’s web presence through one on one meetings with the directors of its centers and initiatives. These conversations informed the common themes and key reasons that the ICL’s web presence is not reaching its intended audience or meeting the directors’ communication goals for the Institute.</p>
        <p class="context">Simultaneously, I conducted a content inventory of the ICL's entire set of web properties. Using the Institute's strategic plan goals, my conversations with the directors, and by studying the University's <a href="http://onmessage.nd.edu" target="new">brand guidelines</a>, I was able to perform in-depth content and usability analysis for these websites.</p>

        <p class="context">ICL published a strategic plan for 2013-2018, outlining the Institute's overall goals. The second session used participatory design exercises to reframe these goals into user stories. I presented a short presentation on content strategy and led a group exercise to identify starting points. Most of these exercises used the <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/kj_technique/" target="new">KJ technique (affinity diagrams)</a>.</p>
        <p class="context">I presented my content and usability analysis in the form of a short talk. Most of the ICL's web properties are published using <a href="http://conductor.nd.edu/" target="new">Conductor</a>, Notre Dame's in-house content management system (CMS). I conducted (no pun intended) a short training session on discovering useful features of the CMS to reach quick wins for both content and usability.</p>

        <p class="context">More importantly, I addressed the directors' concern for wanting to have a distinct voice from the University, while still maintaining its identity. I gave a talk on the <a href="http://onmessage.nd.edu" target="new">University brand principles</a> and how the ICL could leverage them to reach this goal. This talk was followed by a short training session on applying things like type, color, and imagery in their work.</p>

        <p class="context">One of the initial requests the directors of the ICL expressed was guidance on hiring a director-level staff member to oversee all ICL communications, applying best practices and cultivating relationships with University communications stakeholders. Using the conversations and exercises from the two workshops, I coached the directors on where to look for and court ideal candidates. Together, we wrote a job description to post on the University's job board as well as on prominent industry job boards.</p>
