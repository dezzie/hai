               <h1>Dezzie helps make the Internet.</h1>
           

<p>As a former front-end developer, Mac Genius, and doctoral student in psychology, her work experience has curiously been about solving people's problems with science and technology. At the CFPB she has been able to continue advocating for people through planning and moderating UX research, prototyping designs, writing, and helping shape best-practices for a 21st-century government design team. She has worked on internal, consumer-facing, and open source products. Since she can research, design, and code, sheâ€™s known for helping out wherever she can to help something ship on time. Also, she likes numbers.</p>

<p>Her design career probably began 13 years ago, but she actively rejected it. Eventually, she came around, but she wants to make sure her powers are used for good. As for what that means in this industry, she has Opnions. She also wouldn't be a designer if it weren't for being a die-hard trance music fan since 2001. Ask her about that story sometime.</p>




<p>When not working (but also when working), Dezzie likes food, thinking in the abstract, and prefers her music without lyrics. One day she wants to write a history of the Internet, or go into space. You'll find the latest copy of Cook's Illustrated, Psych Science, or the Atlantic on her coffee table.</p>

            <small>The typeface on my resume is <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/arquitecta/" target="new">Arquitecta</a>.
            The typeface on here is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/sanchez/" target="new">Sanchez</a>.
            Both were created by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Latinotype/" target="new">Latinotype</a>. Their name is a pun on what they do for a living. It is also a pun for what I am doing right now.
